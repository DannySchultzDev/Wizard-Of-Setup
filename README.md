Why Winforms:<br/>
I came up with the idea to use winforms as a game engine while using Winforms for my employment as of the date of the game jam.<br/>
When I saw the theme for the 2024 DevDev Game Jam was "What could go wrong", my ideas fell into place, so I decided to make this proof of concept.

Misc Ideas:<br/>
While I don't think I am going to expand on the concept, as the reason I made this in the first place was to avoid spending excess time on this idea, I do have some left over ideas.<br/>
One idea I had was expandable windows. While all the windows in the game are fixed size, I did have the idea that the player could resize blocks to create longer or taller platforms.<br/>
Another idea I had was to use data grid views, which would spawn blocks based on which cells of the grid were selected.
